Assignment 6: A simple FS
-------------------------

You should use the 'make' command to build your filesystem executable
and the formatting program.  We have provided skeleton code in
muicfs.c and muicmkfs.c to get you started.  You will need to fill
in the stub code as specified by the assignment.

Note that you can pass in the '-d' flag to your FUSE executable to
produce debugging output that will help you understand what's going on.
If you do so, however, your program will NOT go into daemon mode, so you
will need to use another terminal to exercise the directory.  Your
executable will exit when you unmount the file system.

Tip: You will find a great deal of resources about FUSE on the Web.
